This project contains R script code looking at sample bike data in order to optimize efficient bike placements for different stations, depending on demand and bikes available.
By utilizing estimated arrival rates to then use in a Poisson Process to simulate demand and trips, we then optimize placements depending on whether customers were "happy" or "unhappy"; essentially referring to whether their trips were completed or not (with bikes available at a given station). Results are then given as a table from our optimization.
